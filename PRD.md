# LLM Evaluation Platform PRD

A comprehensive web-based platform for evaluating language model outputs using industry-standard metrics, supporting both manual single-entry evaluation and bulk CSV processing.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, data-focused interface that builds trust for enterprise use
2. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflows that minimize clicks and cognitive load for evaluators
3. **Insightful** - Rich visualizations and analytics that reveal meaningful patterns in model performance

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Requires sophisticated metric calculations, data visualization, file processing, and persistent storage for evaluation results and user preferences

## Essential Features

### Manual Evaluation Interface
- **Functionality**: Single prompt-response evaluation with automated metrics and manual scoring
- **Purpose**: Quick assessment of individual model outputs with comprehensive analysis
- **Trigger**: User enters question/answer pair and selects evaluation criteria
- **Progression**: Input data → Select metrics → Calculate scores → Review results → Export findings
- **Success criteria**: Accurate metric calculations, intuitive scoring interface, exportable results

### Bulk CSV Processing
- **Functionality**: Batch evaluation of multiple prompt-response pairs from uploaded files
- **Purpose**: Systematic analysis of large datasets for model comparison and benchmarking
- **Trigger**: User uploads CSV file with question/answer columns
- **Progression**: Upload file → Map columns → Configure metrics → Process batch → Analyze results → Export report
- **Success criteria**: Handles 1000+ rows efficiently, progress tracking, comprehensive analytics dashboard

### Metric Calculation Engine
- **Functionality**: Automated scoring using BLEU, ROUGE, semantic similarity, and quality dimensions
- **Purpose**: Standardized, reproducible evaluation metrics for consistent model assessment
- **Trigger**: User initiates evaluation with selected metric combination
- **Progression**: Parse inputs → Apply algorithms → Calculate scores → Aggregate results → Display metrics
- **Success criteria**: Accurate calculations under 2 seconds, configurable metric weights

### Visualization Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Interactive charts, radar plots, and comparison views for evaluation results
- **Purpose**: Transform numerical scores into actionable insights about model performance
- **Trigger**: Completion of single or batch evaluation
- **Progression**: Generate visualizations → Enable filtering → Support comparisons → Export charts
- **Success criteria**: Responsive charts, multiple view modes, export capabilities

## Edge Case Handling
- **Large File Processing**: Chunked processing with pause/resume for files exceeding memory limits
- **Invalid Data**: Graceful handling of malformed CSV rows with detailed error reporting
- **Network Failures**: Retry logic for API calls with exponential backoff
- **Empty Responses**: Appropriate scoring for null or very short model outputs
- **Concurrent Users**: Session isolation and resource management for simultaneous evaluations

## Design Direction
The interface should feel like a professional data analysis tool - clean, sophisticated, and trustworthy - similar to enterprise analytics platforms like Tableau or Power BI, with generous whitespace and purposeful visual hierarchy that guides users through complex workflows.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a professional blue-green palette that conveys trust and analytical precision while maintaining visual interest through strategic accent colors.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#1e40af) - Communicates professionalism, trust, and analytical depth
- **Secondary Colors**: Cool Gray (#64748b) for supporting elements, Light Blue (#dbeafe) for backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Emerald Green (#10b981) - Draws attention to success states, positive metrics, and call-to-action buttons
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White #ffffff): Dark Gray text (#1f2937) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #f8fafc): Dark Gray text (#1f2937) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue #1e40af): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 8.6:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Cool Gray #64748b): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓
  - Accent (Emerald #10b981): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey clarity and precision - using Inter for its excellent readability in data-heavy interfaces and technical documentation contexts.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Metric Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (General Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Helper Text): Inter Regular/14px/muted color
  - Code (Metrics): Inter Mono/14px/monospace for numerical precision

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful motion that reinforces the analytical nature - smooth transitions between evaluation states and gentle feedback for data processing without distracting from the core analytical workflow.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Animations should reinforce data flow and processing states while maintaining professional credibility
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Metric calculations and chart updates deserve prominent animation, while navigation should be subtle

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for evaluation sections, Tables for detailed metrics, Tabs for manual/bulk modes, Progress bars for processing, Charts for visualization, Dialogs for configuration
- **Customizations**: Custom metric calculation components, file upload with drag-drop, advanced data table with sorting/filtering
- **States**: Loading states for calculations, success/error feedback for file processing, hover states for interactive charts
- **Icon Selection**: ChartBar, Upload, Calculator, Download icons that clearly represent analytical functions
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px/24px/32px spacing scale for generous whitespace in data-dense interfaces
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout for evaluation forms, horizontal scrolling for data tables, simplified charts optimized for smaller screens with progressive enhancement for desktop power features
