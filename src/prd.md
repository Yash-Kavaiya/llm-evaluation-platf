### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- H1: 2rem, font-bold (page titles)
- H2: 1.5rem, font-bold (section headers)
- H3: 1.25rem, font-medium (subsections)
- Body: 1rem, font-normal (content)
- Small: 0.875rem, font-normal (metadata)
- Code: Source Code Pro, monospace (formulas, code samples)

**Font Personality**: Inter provides clarity and legibility for data-heavy interfaces
**Readability Focus**: 1.5 line height for body text, generous paragraph spacing
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent heading scales and spacing rhythm
**Which fonts**: Inter (primary), Source Code Pro (monospace), Lora (serif for emphasis)
**Legibility Check**: All fonts tested at minimum 14px size with sufficient contrast

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Card-based layout guides eye from input → configuration → results
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding creates breathing room around dense data
**Grid System**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement
**Content Density**: Balanced information density with collapsible sections for detail

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions communicate state changes and guide attention
**Hierarchy of Movement**: 
1. Interactive feedback (buttons, inputs) - 100-150ms
2. State transitions (loading, success) - 200-300ms  
3. Navigation changes - 300-500ms
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal motion respects user preferences and focuses attention

### UI Elements & Component Selection

**Component States**: Hover, focus, active, disabled states with smooth transitions
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for consistency and clarity
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for main actions, outline buttons for secondary
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's 4px-based scale (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32)
**Mobile Adaptation**: Stack layouts, larger touch targets, simplified navigation

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based with shadcn/ui foundation
**Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system, component states
**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card spacing, section breaks, content alignment
**Brand Alignment**: Professional, analytical, trustworthy aesthetic

## Reflection
This platform uniquely combines standardized evaluation metrics with custom formula creation and comprehensive analytics, enabling both general-purpose LLM assessment and domain-specific evaluation criteria. The six-tab structure (Manual, Bulk, Custom, Responsible AI, RAG, Analytics) provides progressive complexity while maintaining usability across different use cases.

The custom metric builder particularly addresses the gap where existing tools force users into predefined evaluation criteria that may not match their specific use cases. The advanced analytics dashboard elevates the platform from a simple evaluation tool to a comprehensive LLM performance monitoring system, enabling data-driven optimization decisions.

The assumptions around client-side processing and browser-based persistence keep deployment simple while limiting scale. Future considerations include server-side processing for larger datasets and integration with LLM APIs for real-time evaluation.

What makes this solution truly exceptional is the combination of three key innovations: 1) the custom metric builder's formula editor that empowers domain experts to encode evaluation knowledge, 2) the comprehensive analytics dashboard that transforms evaluation data into actionable insights, and 3) the integrated approach that tracks evaluation history across all assessment methods for holistic performance monitoring.
